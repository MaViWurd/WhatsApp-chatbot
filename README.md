Yes, you can start by setting up a Node.js application on your local machine and creating a webhook to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp. You will need to have a publicly accessible URL for the webhook, which can be achieved by using a service like ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local machine. Once the webhook is set up, you can start building the logic to handle incoming messages and interact with your MySQL database. Keep in mind that this approach would only work for testing and development purposes, and you would need to deploy your application to a live server for production use.
